## What needs done:
* Pipelines
    * GitHub Actions
        * explore capabilities 
    * TeamCity 
        * Build dev branch on each commit
        * if commit builds, then allow for merging to master
        * compile master to create jar, apk, all platforms
        * automatically deploy apk to Google Play (gradle task)
        * seperate builds, desktop builds first, then trigger android, then HTML (seperate builds so that desktop can be tested successfully, HTML will always fail)
